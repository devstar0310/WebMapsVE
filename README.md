# Simplovation Web.Maps.VE
The only ASP.NET Ajax Bing Maps Server Control

**[Download via Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Web.Maps.VE/)**

Web.Maps.VE is the only ASP.NET Ajax Bing Maps Server Control. Allowing you to integrate Bing Maps mapping functionality into your ASP.NET Web Forms applications without requring you to write any JavaScript. Even though you are not required to write JavaScript, there is still a FULL JavaScript API exposed that allows you to customize the map any way you want.

**Project Dependencies:**
This project works with ASP.NET Web Forms only. It is not compatible with ASP.NET MVC. As a result of the Web Forms dependency, this project is not compatible with ASP.NET Core 1.0.

**Documentation:**
Currently the documentation for this control is still located over on the CodePlex project site located here:
[http://webmapsve.codeplex.com/documentation](http://webmapsve.codeplex.com/documentation)


**History:**
This server control was originally released as a proprietary product of [Simplovation LLC](http://simplovation.com). The initial release of the product was in October 2007. In April 2014 the control was released as Open Source to the [Web.Maps.VE CodePlex site](http://webmapsve.codeplex.com). In March 2016, the Web.Maps.VE open source project was moved over to this GitHub site so that further work could be done to work on migrating the control from the using Bing Maps v6.3 JavaScript control over to the Bing Maps v7 JavaScript control. The reason for the upgrade work is that in the Fall of 2016, the v6.3 Bing Maps control is being depricated and only the v7 control will be supported by Microsoft.
